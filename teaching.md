My primary educational goal is to enhance
statistical literacy and communication among my students. To me, statistical
literacy means combining careful data analysis with scientific
expertise to grapple with problems. Given the quantity of data available
today, I want my students to learn how to engage in the type
of quantitative reasoning and decision making necessary for
understanding
applications in the sciences, business, and public policy.
Going beyond the didacticism of basic statistical literacy, I strive
to inform students about the
fundamental role statistics plays in the comprehension of real-world
phenomena across disciplines and to motivate them to
use this knowledge in their daily lives.
Finally, I endeavor to cultivate curiosity in my students and to create an open and
nurturing learning environment.
This conception of my role as a pedagogue has informed the choices I have
made in the design and implementation of my courses, and I work every
day to inspire my students to develop a similar view. Beyond
statistics, I feel strongly that it is important to connect with students from
backgrounds that do not come to college with the same financial
resources, cultural capital, and training as more privileged
demographics.      



## Current courses

### S771/S772/785 - Seminar on Statistical Theory ([Fa19--Sp20](https://github.com/stats-771fa2019))

### S432 - Applied Linear Models II (Sp20)

### S352 - Intro to Statistical Modeling (Sp20)


## Past courses at IUB

### S432 - Applied Linear Models II (Sp16) ([Sp17](https://github.com/STATS-432Sp2017)) ([Sp18](https://stats-432sp2018.github.io/))

This is a course in advanced data analysis. Based on the theory of
linear models covered in S431, this course will focus on applying many
types of data analysis methods to interesting datasets. The focus will
be dealing with and describing data rather than on particular methods
per se.

The course combines analysis with methodology and
computational aspects. It treats both the "art" of understanding
unfamiliar data and the "science" of analyzing that data in terms of
statistical properties. The focus will be on practical aspects of methodology and intuition
to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and
approaches to problems in their own lives. 

I expect that the material should be appropriate and interesting to
students coming from either statistics or informatics/computer
science. I will make an effort to provide necessary background so that
lectures are accessible to both populations.

### S782 - Topics in Statistical Learning Theory ([Fa17](https://github.com/stats-782fa2017))

Statistical learning theory is a burgeoning research field at the
intersection of probability, statistics, computer science, and
optimization that studies the performance of computer algorithms for
making predictions on the basis of training data.

The following topics will be covered: basics of statistical decision
theory; concentration inequalities; supervised and unsupervised
learning; empirical risk minimization; complexity-regularized
estimation; generalization bounds for learning algorithms; VC
dimension and Rademacher complexities; minimax lower bounds; online
learning and optimization.

Along with the general theory, we will
discuss a number of applications of statistical learning theory to
signal processing, information theory, and adaptive control.

### S771/S772/785 - Seminar on Statistical Theory ([Fa16](https://github.iu.edu/dajmcdon/s771)) ([Sp17](https://github.iu.edu/dajmcdon/s771))

This course is intended to  help Statistics Ph.D. students learn
to read academic literature, write statistical papers, and present
their findings orally. It is a required course leading to the data
analysis qualifying exam, and is generally open only to statistics
students.

### S301 - Introduction to Business Statistics (Fa13) (Sp14) (Fa14)

### S682 - Topics in Mathematical Statistics: Machine Learning (Sp14)

The course includes topics in statistical theory that are now
becoming important for researchers in machine learning, including
consistency, minimax estimation, and concentration of measure. It
also presents topics in computation including elements of convex
optimization, variational methods, randomized projection algorithms,
and techniques for handling large data sets.

I expect that the material should be appropriate and interesting
to students coming from either statistics or informatics/computer
science. I will make an effort to provide necessary background so
that lectures are accessible to both populations.

### Advanced Statistical Theory I (Fa12) (Fa14)

Mathematical introduction to major areas of probability theory
and statistics including set theory and VC dimension, random
variables, distribution functions, expectations, exponential
families, inequalities and concentration of measure, convergence,
estimation theory.

### Advanced Statistical Theory II (Sp13)

Mathematical introduction to major areas of statistical theory
including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, density
estimation, nonparametric regression, classification, and
prediction, with special emphasis on minimaxity, tuning parameter
selection, and risk.

## At the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business

### 41-911 Advanced Econometrics ([Aut18](https://booth41911.github.io))

## At the Institute for New Economic Thinking

### Short Course on Machine Learning (Sp13) (Sp15)

As part of the Young Scholars Institute at the INET Hong Kong
conference from April 2-3, 2013, Darren Homrighausen and I taught a
course on statistical learning. I retaught the course in New York February 24-26, 2015. The slides, code, data, and other
materials from that class are available at the links above.
